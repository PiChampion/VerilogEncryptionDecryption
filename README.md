# VerilogEncryptionDecryption

This project was completed as part of ECE 310 course at NC State. The purpose of this project was to implement an RSA encryption and decryption module using Verilog. Given a message M, the message will need to be raised to the power of a private key and reduce modulo of the public key. To accomplish these tasks, an exponentiation operation module and modulo operation module were written and included in the top-level module.

The testbench is uncluded in the proj2.v file.
